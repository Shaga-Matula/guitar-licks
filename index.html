                        "Music creates order out of chaos: for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the divergent,

                        imposes
                        continuity upon the disjointed, and harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous."

                        Paul is the real deal. I am a kindergarten teacher taking ukulele lessons with Joe. He really

                        music
                        theory, but most importantly for me, he knows how to teach in a way that is fun and
                        supportive.
                        He
                        is
                        especially good at meeting me where I am at as a musician and taking me to the next level.
                        You
                        will
                        love
